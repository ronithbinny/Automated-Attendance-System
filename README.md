# Automated-Attendance-System
It is a simple, fast and basic self-automated attendance system. For this project I have used Python with Numpy, Pandas, OpenCV, face_recognition, OS and datetime. First we create a student database using web cam with OpenCV, then convert the images and labels to list using face_recognition and predict the class using SVM Classifier.
